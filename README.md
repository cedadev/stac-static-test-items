Static test items for testing STAC against


We have selected a few directories in the CEDA archive to manaually create STAC items and catalogues from. 
The list of directories is in `directories.txt`

This covers a broad range of datasets. items in `/badc/deposited2022` are from unstructured deposits. CMIP5, sentinel, eprofile and faam 
have a very structured approach. Others are selected as examples of older data. Each directory may result in more than one item.
